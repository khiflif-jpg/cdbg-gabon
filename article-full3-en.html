      <h2>CDBG News – Africa’s Timber Industry Update – October 2025</h2>
<h2>Gabon Strengthens Its Position as Africa’s Hub for Sustainable Wood Processing</h2>
<p>The Gabonese government is reinforcing its ambition to make the country a leading hub for sustainable and value-added wood products in Central Africa. According to the Ministry of Water, Forests and Environment, more than 140 processing companies are now operating within the Nkok Special Economic Zone (ZES Nkok), producing plywood, veneers, and high-end furniture for export. Managed by the Gabon Special Economic Zone (GSEZ), the Nkok SEZ has become a continental model for green industrialization, promoting local processing of forest resources and limiting raw log exports.In 2025, exports from the zone exceeded CFA 500 billion (approximately USD 820 million), with major markets including China, India, Morocco, and the European Union. Minister of Water, Forests and Environment, Colonel Maurice Ntossui Allogo, stated that Gabon aims to become Africa’s benchmark center for certified and sustainable timber, while boosting employment, technology, and local competitiveness.</p>
<h2>Toward Full FSC Certification of Gabonese Forests by 2026</h2>
<p>Gabon is steadily advancing its goal of becoming the first African nation where all forest concessions are FSC-certified (Forest Stewardship Council). By the end of Q3 2025, over 5.3 million hectares of forest had already achieved certification—around 75% of all managed forest areas. The remaining concessions are in the process of certification with support from the Agency for the Implementation of Forest-Wood Sector Activities (AEAFFB) and FSC Africa. This initiative forms part of the country’s national strategy for sustainable forest resource management and compliance with the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).</p>
<h2>Major Public Investments in Forest Infrastructure</h2>
<p>To support local processing and improve sector logistics, the government launched in 2025 the Integrated Industrial Forestry Development Program, backed by USD 120 million in financing over three years, in partnership with the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Bank. The program includes the modernization of the Owendo Port, rehabilitation of forest roads in Ogooué-Ivindo and Ngounié, and the establishment of regional processing and technical training hubs.</p>
<h2>“Made in Gabon” Furniture Gaining Ground</h2>
<p>The Gabonese private sector, through the Wood Industries Promotion Agency (APIB), is investing in locally designed and manufactured furniture to diversify exports and add value to native timber species such as okoumé, ozigo, and padouk. The Libreville Wood and Design Fair, held in September 2025, gathered more than 80 Gabonese exhibitors and attracted buyers from France, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco.</p>
<h2>Wood Exports Show Mixed but Resilient Performance</h2>
<p>Data from the National Wood Council show that total exports fell by 8% compared to 2024, largely due to slower Chinese demand. However, exports to Europe and the Middle East grew by 14% and 9% respectively, driven by rising demand for certified and traceable timber.</p>
<h2>A Forest Economy at the Heart of Sustainable Development</h2>
<p>The forestry sector remains one of Gabon’s key economic pillars, contributing around 6.5% of GDP and generating more than 20,000 direct jobs. Through full certification, industrial modernization, and market diversification, Gabon is positioning itself as a model for sustainable forest management in Africa and a key player in the global responsible timber value chain.</p>
